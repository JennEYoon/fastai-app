# App2 - Practice reading in image files to Fastai

 * Created cats folder with sample images downloaded from internet 
 * Created csv file with labels  
 * Image load into memory and show, using pathlib object, local and google Colab.  
    - all done.  write up  
 * Using library pillow, matplotlib, scikit-image, opencv - in process.  

 * Fastai deep learning, needs 2 folders, train and test.  
   - images need uniform squares, resize to 128 x 128?  or smaller.
   - Use planets tiny to split into 2 folders, train and test.  
   - load planets tiny into fastai.  

 * Run training using pre-trained models  

 * Create a baseline using only 2 categories, primary forest and [road or settlement]  Try simpler regression or clustering.
