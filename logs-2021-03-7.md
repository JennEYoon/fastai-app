# Working logs, fastai software, app web.  

#### March 22, 2021 6 am:  
 * DataLoader documentation, tutorial, fastai nb.  
 * Provides various ways to manipulate data.  
 * still not sure where "untar_data(URLs, xxx)" gets its http link.  
   - maybe part of PyTorch?  For standard datasets?  Same as for TF.  
 * Documentation for 1 mnist image is easiest to understand.  
   - https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.pets  
 * Source code gives most detail.  
   - https://github.com/JennEYoon/fastai-app/blob/main/fastai/nbs/02_data.load.ipynb  
 * Chp 11 confusing, tokenizer data loading example.

#### July 3, 2021:  
  * Recombined all fastbook and fastai class work to "deep-learning" repo.  
  * Keep my notes on studying fastai v2 library here.  
  * Keep notes on figuring out how to load image files to fastai models.
