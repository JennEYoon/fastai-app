# fastai-app
My hosted web app, from fastai 2020 class  

***To repurpose as blog github.io***  

Jan 15, 2021 note.  
Don't remove repo - keep as testing repo.  

 * app1 folder -- my testing notebooks, chp 1, 2, 4, 5  
 * fastai folder -- full software v2, for studying  
 

Smaller repo size, easier to start in binder.org  
Colab, one place to look for fastai notebooks.  

### Binder:
Add environment.yml file to root - done.  
**fastai20env.yml** - has fastai version 2, fastcore. 

### Colab:  
Find a way to load book, fastai setup, init on CPU/GPU.  
PyTorch 1 version works with both CPU and GPU engines now.
