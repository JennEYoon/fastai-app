# fastai-app
My hosted web app, from fastai 2020 class

Jan 15, 2021 note.  
Don't remove repo - keep as testing repo.  
"nbs" only has clean notebooks, not full book text. 

Smaller repo size, easier to start in binder.org  
Colab, one place to look for fastai notebooks.  
Add environment.yml file to root, folders for book content, images.
