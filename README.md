# fastai-app

June 11, 2021 note  
Moved my fastbook working notebooks to this repo from deep-learning repo.  
Combine with other fastai related folders, fastai software, fastbook copy 


Jan 15, 2021 note.  
Don't remove repo - keep as testing repo.  

 * app1 folder -- my testing notebooks, chp 1, 2, 4, 5  
 * fastai folder -- full fastai v2 library, for studying  
 * fastbook folder -- full copy of book notebooks, for studying  

Smaller repo size, easier to start in binder.org  
Colab, one place to look for fastai notebooks.  

### Binder:
Add environment.yml file to root - done.  
**fastai20env.yml** - has fastai version 2, fastcore. Need nbdev to use scripts.  

### Colab:  
PyTorch works with both CPU and GPU engines now.  
With Colab open and logged into my account, can upload notebook from local laptop.  
Exported model trained on GPU, re-export model from CPU-engine, to import/train further on CPU.
