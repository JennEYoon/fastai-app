# fastai-app
My hosted web app, from fastai 2020 class

Jan 15, 2021 note.  
Don't remove repo - keep as testing repo.  
"nbs" only has clean notebooks, not full book text. 

Smaller repo size, easier to start in binder.org  
Colab, one place to look for fastai notebooks.  

### Binder:
Add environment.yml file to root - done.  
fast20.yml  

### Colab:  
Find a way to load book, fastai setup, init on CPU/GPU.  
PyTorch 1 version works with both CPU and GPU engines now.
