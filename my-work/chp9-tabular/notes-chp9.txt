# to do, Random Forest part, chp 9 
### June Meetup, finish up chp 9.  

Edit path for 5 images to ../../images path.  

Google Colab, find a way to point to .kaggle/kaggle.json folder from my mounted google drive.  
Need to change fastai code to use different destination.  


Mounted user drive is "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks"

import os
with open('filename', 'rw') as f:  
   os.dump(api_key, f)
   
api_key is kaggle token.  

Colab -- no access to "/root/.kaggle/' folder.  Can't rename folder using . in folder name.  
This option fails, so need a way to change fastai code path to /content/drive.
