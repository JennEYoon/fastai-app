# Setup notes for fastai app1, notebook2.  

Need to use GPU for training.  Just using environment.yml does not work.  Packages assume GPU.  
Try using alternative GPU service to Google.  
After it is trained and app is developed, can serve up on CPU, MyBinder.org app.  
Can't load on my laptop CPU as is.  

Docker image available -- may be better.  

Need software "fastai" and content from book "fastbook"  
C Windows - removed all conda environments except base, python = 3.6
Nov 30, 2020. 

pip freeze > requirements.txt  allows you to save every library loaded with versions.  
Use to create a complete environment.  
May still need to load full fastbook each time.  
Fastbook setup file many have more information.
